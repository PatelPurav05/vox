# Vox – Voice-Based IDE

Vox is a voice-first coding environment built to make programming more accessible. Whether you're dealing with physical limitations or just want to give your hands a break, Vox lets you build software using only your voice.

## What It Does

- Translate speech to working code
- Navigate through your files and folders by voice
- Search through code without touching the keyboard
- Get AI-powered suggestions and refactors through spoken prompts
- Run terminal commands with your voice

## Why We Built It

One of our teammates struggled with carpal tunnel, and it made us think—what happens when your hands can’t keep up, but your mind still can? Vox was built to bridge that gap. It’s a tool for anyone who wants to write code without needing to type.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Rust (if compiling natively)
- Tauri CLI
- A decent mic

## Tech Stack

- Tauri for native desktop build
- Vite (React) for UI
- Vapi + Gemini for voice processing and LLM
- Rust for secure system-level operations
